	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>
		I aspire to live each day as fully as possible. Sometimes that means doing my best to do nothing at all. Our bodies and minds are at their best when we feel purpose and necessity for our actions. My mission is to put myself in a position where all that I do has a positive effect on both myself and those around me.

		I work as a growth hacker for a small digital agency where I manage account and create campaigns to effectively achieve our clients goals. I DJ and Produce electronic music whenever I get the chance and I currently co-host a monthly brunch event in midtown Sacramento. I am currently involved in a few projects that focus on cryptocurrency, data analysis, and machine learning.
